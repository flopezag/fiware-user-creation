# Setting up a stand-alone FIWARE Lab User Create service

This describes how to deploy FIWARE Lab User Create service an 
[ansible](http://www.ansible.com) playbook. This has been tested on the 
[FIWARE Lab](https://cloud.lab.fiware.org) cloud.

It will install the service and the different configurations file in order 
to create automatically new FIWARE Lab user accounts (Trial) inside the FIWARE 
Lab taking into account the information that we keep in the Google Spreadsheet 
and the information that we have in the JIRA ticketing system.

Additionally, it autoconfigure the tool in order to use it every day through 
the configuration of the proper crontab service.

## How to start it

* Create virtualenv and activate it:

    virtualenv -p python2.7 $NAME_VIRTUAL_ENV
    source $NAME_VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/activate

* Install the requirements:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

* Edit the setup variables to fit your setup. Open `vars/data.yml` and setup
  the variables as explained there.

* One all the variables are in place you should now be able to deploy and 
  configure the service. Just run the following command:

    ansible-playbook -vvvv -i inventory.yml \
    --private-key=(Key pair to access to the instance) \
    deploy_user-create.yml
